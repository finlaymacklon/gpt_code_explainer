### Guide for making a GPT Code Explainer

Simple guide for making a custom GPT through the OpenAI ChatGPT user interface that explains the source code of some repository.

##### Note: Alternatively, it is simpler to load a repository in VSCode and use the `chat` tab then prepend prompts with `@workspace` if you have a GitHub Copilot subscription.

### Requirements

- ChatGPT Pro subscription

### Instructions

1) Log in to https://chat.openai.com
2) Go to https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor
3) On the `Configure` tab, enter the information provided in the below `Configuration` section (Replace `{}` with the name of the repository you are making this for).
    - Adjust conversation starters as needed
4) Upload a zip file named `source_code.zip` containing all of the repository's source code as a knowledge file for the GPT.
5) On the `Create` tab, ask the helper GPT to improve the instructions and conversation starters as needed

### Configuration

- Note: Replace `{}` with the name of the repository you are making this for

| {} Explainer |
|--------------|
| **Description** |
| Provides detailed explanations of {} code and concepts. |
| **Instructions** |
| {} Explainer is specifically focused on elucidating the internals of the {} framework, aiding users in understanding the underlying mechanics and source code structure of {}. It will always leverage the 'source_code.zip' (before answering) to provide insights into how {} operates internally, offering detailed explanations of its architecture, core functionalities, and the design decisions behind its API. The assistant aims to deepen the user's comprehension of {}'s internal workings, rather than merely guiding on building applications with it. This nuanced focus will enable users to gain a more profound understanding of the framework, enhancing their ability to debug, extend, or optimize their {}-based projects. The GPT will continue to ask for clarifications when necessary to deliver the most accurate and insightful explanations about the {} internals. |
| **Conversation Starters** |
| Can you explain the architecture of {} as outlined in the source code? |
| Could you break down the main components of {} as seen in the source code? |
| Could you provide a visual/text-based tree diagram of the source code directory to help me understand its structure better? |
| What design patterns are used in the {} source code? |
